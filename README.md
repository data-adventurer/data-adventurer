From the open grasslands of South Africa to the vibrant energy of New York, my journey has been one of adaptation and exploration. With a background in **Mechanical Engineering**, I’ve built a diverse skill set across industries like **hospitality, child care, inventory control**, and **manufacturing** — experiences that sharpened my problem-solving skills and adaptability in dynamic environments.  

My passion for puzzle-solving and uncovering insights led me to transition into **data analytics**. I earned a **Master’s in Data Analysis** from **Western Governors University**, where my capstone project explored how **language and location** influence key performance metrics using **MANOVA**. Along the way, I've gained strong expertise in **Python, R, SQL**, and the **data life cycle**, helping me uncover actionable insights and drive better decisions.
